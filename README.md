# Benchmark - Simple Fractal Coding Challenge

First of all, I would like to thank you for the opportunity of working on this coding challenge as I learned so much including Python, Pandas, Flask, and adding React Charts. More importantly, I had better understanding how python + pandas can automate/optimize processes in various ways. I look forward to discussing more about this project with you and hearing your suggestion to improve my codes. 

## how to run the app (through Mac)

## In the flask-server folder, you can run:
#### activate server: `source venv/bin/activate`
#### install flask: `pip3 install Flask`
#### run backend server `python3 server.py`

## In the frontend folder, you can run: 
#### install packages: `npm install`
#### react-scripts start: `npm start`
#### If not auto directed, go to `http://localhost:3000/`
